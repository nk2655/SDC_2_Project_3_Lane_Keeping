# SDC_2_Project_3_Lane_Keeping
* This project will start on March 2nd based on PID Control and Linear Quadratic Regulator.  
* This module is built with our partners at Uber Advanced Technologies Group. Uber is one of the fastest-moving companies in the autonomous vehicle space. They are already testing their self-driving cars in multiple locations in the US, and theyâ€™re excited to introduce students to the core control algorithms that autonomous vehicles use.
